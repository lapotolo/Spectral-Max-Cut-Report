\maketitle

\begin{abstract}
This survey paper presents an overview of graph cut problems. The main focus is on MAX-CUT, a famous network related problem known to be NP-HARD.
The three classical and trivial 2-approximation algorithms are given. Then a brief introduction of spectral graph theory is presented, showing how to exploit algebraic properties of matrices associated to graphs to achieve better approximation ratios for MAX-CUT.
