\section{Spectral Max Cut}
We saw that the largest eigenvalue $ \lambda_n $ of the Laplacian matrix of a graph $ G $ is $ 2 $ if and only if $ G $ contains a bipartite connected component. Since $ \lambda_n $ is a continuous value that has a discrete and combinatorial effect on the topology of the relative graph, we may hope to find a measure of how close a graph is to be bipartite with respect to how close is $ \lambda_n $ to $ 2 $.
We have to introduce and prove the correctedness and the soundness of a parameter that is zero if and only
if the graph has a bipartite connected component, and it is small if and only if the graph is
close to contain a bipartite connected components.
